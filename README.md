# Covid-19 Tracker
<br>This app serves as a comprehensive tool for tracking Covid-19 statistics. It marks my inaugural project wherein I employed APIs to fetch data from servers and display it in my Flutter application. Below are the links to the APIs utilized in my app:</br>
<br>1.Global Covid-19 Data Link-https://disease.sh/v3/covid-19/all</br>
<br>2.Country-wise Covid-19 Data-https://disease.sh/v3/covid-19/countries</br>
<br>The first API link is dedicated to the initial page, where a holistic overview of Covid-19 data is presented, complemented by an informative pie chart. The second API link is specifically designed for acquiring country-wise data, which is then seamlessly integrated into the third page.</br>
